# Blog

This is a very simple blog where I post all my thoughts about software development and companies.
It's based in the Mediumish theme by @wowthemesnet [you can check their documentation](https://bootstrapstarter.com/template-mediumish-bootstrap-jekyll/) 

Example of an image:

<p class="mb-5"><img class="shadow-lg" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/mediumish-jekyll-template.png" alt="jekyll template mediumish" /></p>
