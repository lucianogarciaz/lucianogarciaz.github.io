There’s this idea I really like: “Strong opinions, weakly held.”
It means forming a point of view with conviction, but being willing to let it go the moment reality proves you wrong. Not clinging to being right, but being committed to learning.

It sounds easy in theory. In practice, it’s hard. Especially when your identity gets wrapped up in your ideas.

When I started Nubexpert, I was sure the most important thing was to build a solid product. I believed deeply that good design, clear code, and an AI that could answer 80% of messages would be enough. I was wrong. It turns out sales matter more than features. Timing matters more than polish. And most importantly, talking to people matters more than talking to code.

But I didn’t change my mind overnight. I clung to the idea that “if we make it great, people will come.”
I needed to be proven wrong more than once. What helped wasn’t logic, it was reality hitting me in the face. No traction. Silence. Indifference. That’s louder than any metric.

Eventually I realized I had to let go. Not just of features, but of assumptions.
That didn’t make me feel smart. It made me feel unsure.
But maybe that’s the whole point: having strong opinions helps you move. Holding them weakly helps you survive.

This idea hasn’t just shaped how I build startups, it’s changed how I think about friendships, goals, even how I see myself. There’s something freeing about realizing you don’t have to be right, just honest. Especially with yourself.
